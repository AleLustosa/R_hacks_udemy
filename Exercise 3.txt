In this exercise we will create the 2013 to 2016 sub-folders in the weather folder and populate them
 with the csv files from the zip files folders for each corresponding year.

1 Load the tidyverse library

2 Create the 2013 to 2016 sub-folders in the Weather folder using the walk() function
  Note that you may have to create a function that will create a single folder then use that with the walk()

3 Create a function that would import 100,000 rows from any of the csv files in the Exercise data folder
  and write in to the corresponding folders you created in in step 2

4 Use that function with a walk() to loop through 2013 to 2016

Bonus

5 Delete the csv you just created

6 repeat step 3 but rather than reading (or importing) and writing (exporting) use copy and paste

8 repeat step 4 with the function from step 6

9 Save, commit, and push to github
