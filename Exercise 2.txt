1 load the tidyverse and R.utils libraries

2 list files in the zip files/Exercise Data/ path. Get the full path.

3 save these paths to a vector. Call it myzipfile

4 use a for() loop to unzip these files. Make sure to use remove = F to keep both the zipped and unzipped files

5 Use one of the following ways to delete the .csv files you just unzipped. We want to redo it with a walk

 a manually remove by selecting the file and removing them or 

 b run these scripts

   file.remove("Zip files/Excersise Data/2013.csv")

   rm_files <- list.files(path = 'Zip files/Excersise Data/', pattern = 'csv$', full.names = T)
   walk(.x = rm_files, .f = file.remove)

6 use the walk() function to unzip the same files in the Exercise Data/folder

7 Save the script, commit, push to github, and verrify it uploaded
